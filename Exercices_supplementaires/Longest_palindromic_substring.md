# Longest Palindromic Substring Variants

Write a C program to find the longest palindromic substring of a given string. Maximum length of the given string is 1000.

Expected Output:

```
Original String: yxypxst 
Longest palindromic substring of the said string: yxy
```

Then write some tests using CUnit to verify the correctness of your implementation.
